## What is mDrawBot ?

mDrawbot is a four-in-one drawing robotic kit, you can assembly into 4 different configuration drawing robots: **mScara, mCar, mSpide and mEggBot**. This kit consists of Makeblock parts. We designed a powerful software named mDraw to control these robots, it also can control the XY Plotter V2.0 based on Makeblock platform.


#### **mScara**

mScara is a SCARA （Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm）drive by stepper motor. If you install a pen on mScara, it can draw the pattern on a flat surface. If you install the laser upgrade pack, it can turn into a desktop laser engraver machine.
